**only if you get error on running pip3 install SpeechRecognition **

You may need to make changes in line 11 in bin/pip

to avoid ImportError: cannot import name 'main'

so make a virtual environment and change the bin/pip file in it. NOT recommended to change the usr/bin/pip

change from : sys.exit(main())

to : sys.exit(_main())

Also if you donâ€™t have pyaudio installed :

sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev

pip3 install --allow-unverified=pyaudio pyaudio
